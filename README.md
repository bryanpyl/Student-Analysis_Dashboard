# ðŸ“Š Student Performance Dashboard

## Overview
A Streamlit-based web application for analyzing and visualizing student's general performance data. The dashboard processes uploaded Excel/CSV files containing student records and provides analytics including grade distributions and class comparisons in charts, and the results can be exported to CSV or PDF format with set report title and file name.

## Features

### ðŸ“Œ Core Functionality
- **File Processing**: Handles both Excel (multi-sheet) and CSV files
- **Data Analysis**:
  - Grade distribution statistics (overall and by class)
  - Mean score comparisons across classes
  - Benchmark analysis against cohort average
  - K-means clustering of assessment patterns
- **Visualizations**:
  - Interactive bar charts and pie charts
  - Scatter plots for cluster analysis
- **Reporting**:
  - CSV export of analyzed data
  - PDF report generation with all visualizations

### ðŸ“‚ Data Requirements
Input Excel spreadsheet should contain these columns (case-insensitive):
- `Name` - Student names
- `Gender` - Male(M) /Female(F)
- `Class` - Class identifier (e.g., 1A, 2A, 10Sc1)
- `Assessment` - Continuous Assessment percentage (%)
- `Examination` - Exam percentage (%)
- `Total` - Combined score between Assessment and Examination
- `Grade` - Letter grade (A*, A, B, C, D etc.)

You may name your sheets as the class name in the spreadsheets. The software supports multiple class-sheets in one Excel spreadsheet.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 (when deploy at Streamlit)
- pip package manager

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd student-performance-dashboard
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Or manually install:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit pandas matplotlib scikit-learn fpdf
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. In your browser:
   - Upload a properly formatted Excel/CSV file
   - Explore the interactive visualizations
   - Generate and download reports

## Report Contents
Generated PDF reports include:
    - Summary statistics
    - Grade distribution tables
    - Class performance comparisons  
    - All visualizations:
        - Grade distribution charts
        - Performance cluster plots
        - Benchmark analysis

## Customization
To modify the application:
- Edit `app.py` to change analysis logic
- Adjust `grade_order` variable for different grading systems
- Modify visualization parameters in the plotting functions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **File Format Errors**:
   - Ensure column names match exactly
   - Remove special characters from headers
   - Verify numeric columns contain only numbers or 'ABS'

2. **Visualization Problems**:
   - Large datasets may require plot adjustments
   - Try reducing the number of classes displayed

3. **PDF Generation Failures**:
   - Ensure temporary directory permissions
   - Check for matplotlib backend conflicts
